# strok_predection-
We have two parts of the project:
1-----Early strok prediction:

* We use this data 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mahatiratusher/stroke-risk-prediction-dataset/data
Then applied data preprocessing 
* Then, we utilized the Tabnet Model and Achieved SatisFactory results. 
Additionally, we use a DNN to Obtain better results


2-----Stroke prediction: 

* We use this data 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/afridirahman/brain-stroke-ct-image-dataset
â€¦ and applied data preprocessing on it  
* Then, we utilized the ConvNeXt model, which achieved excellent results.
